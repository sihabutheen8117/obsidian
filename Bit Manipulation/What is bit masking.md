 allows only certine bits pass throgh will blocking others bits 


### How it is Works

a ->  10111
b ->  00100  ( doing AND operations )
ans->00100

so we can find that a contains 1 in the 3rd postions

to move the bit left we can do left shift 

b -> 01000 (left shift  )

so that we can check next bit

b is called masking ( mask for a )

### Implementations

-> find all the posibilities in the array
