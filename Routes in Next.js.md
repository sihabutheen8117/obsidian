- we know what is route and how to use it.
- that is usual route.
- here we will be special routes.

### Parallel Rouets.
- it is just amazing thing.
- assume that we are building a dashboard , in that dashboard we have heading , navigation ,messages and groups.
- if we wants to show it to the one page we usually use , create compoenent for that and import it to the layout and use it in the layout.

- but what parallel route does it , it actully create a route , that is not exact route , it create a file for heading ,navigation ,and groups etc..,
- the file name will be '@navigation' like that,
- inside this file we have page file to define navigation. for other the concept is same.
- and it will automatically passes as a props to it parent route (here dashboard).
- and we can simply use them.

what is the benefite of these.
- these are seen as the route , not actual routes kind of routes , we cant get it in url like dashboard/@navigation (not found).
- each has its own 404 and error pages and loading pages.
