#### What is mongoose
- Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data. Mongoose helps you work with MongoDB collections by creating and managing documents in a more structured and organized way, ensuring validation, type casting, query building, and business logic hooks.

#### What is (ODM)
- ODM stands for **Object-Document Mapping**. It is a concept in software development that allows developers to interact with databases in an object-oriented way, particularly when working with **document-based databases** like **MongoDB**.

#### What ODM Does:

An ODM provides a bridge between the **documents** in a database and the **objects** in your programming language (such as JavaScript or Python). It allows you to work with data using objects instead of writing complex queries directly to the database.
