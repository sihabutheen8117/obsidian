1. Break the app into components 
    We looked at the desired UI and determined we wanted ProductList and Product components. 
2. Build a static version of the app 
    Our components started off without using state. Instead, we had ProductList pass down static props to Product. 
3. Determine what should be stateful 
    In order for our application to become interactive, we had to be able to modify the vote property on each product. Each product had to be mutable and therefore stateful. 
4. Determine in which component each piece of state should live 
    ProductList managed the voting state using React component class methods. 
5. Hard-code initial state 
    When we re-wrote ProductList to use this.state, we seeded it from Seed.products. 
6. Add inverse data flow 
   We defined the handleUpVote function in ProductList and passed it down in props so that each Product could inform ProductList of up-vote events. 
7. Add server communication 
    We did not add a server component to our last app, but we will be doing so in this one.
