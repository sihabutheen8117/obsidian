### What is Babel?
Babel is a JavaScript transpiler. Babel turns ES6 code into ES5 code. We call this process transpiling. So we can enjoy the features of ES6 today yet ensure our code still runs in browsers that only support ES5.
Babel compiles our JSX into vanilla ES5 JS that our browser can then interpret and execute.

#### transpiling - Converting to one form to other form.
